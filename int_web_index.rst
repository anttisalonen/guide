In this section we'll turn our guessing game from a single HTML page to a simple web app.

We'll start by adding some logic to gain some more experience in JS, and then learn about the following topics:

* JSON; which we'll need to transfer data between backend and frontend
* HTML table generation
* AJAX; data transfer between backend and frontend in practice
* Setting up a simple NoSQL database
* Putting everything together

What we'll end up is a two-page guessing game as well as a simple algorithm to play it for us, with a hiscore list displayed on the page and stored in a database. It doesn't sound like much but includes lots of software development fundamentals.
