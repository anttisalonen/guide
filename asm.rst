Under the hood
--------------

We've now used a couple of languages and gotten some meaningful output out of them, but we haven't really gone into the details of how exactly do they tell the CPU what to do.

In general, as we know, the CPU executes instructions, one after the other. If we program in a language such as C, our compiler typically takes our code and turns it into a listing of CPU instructions.
