Editors
-------

  I've seen [visual] editors like that, but I don't feel a need for them. I don't want to see the state of the file when I'm editing.

  -- Ken Thompson

In general, the editor is an important part of the *edit-compile-run* cycle. The editor should make you, the developer, as efficient when reading and writing code as possible. While any editor is enough to get started so that you can read and write files, some editors have capabilities that improve productivity and reduce tediousness of editing code.

There are a few classical editors and while there's no shame in using another or a simpler editor (even nano), in this book we'll deep dive to one of the more advanced ones: vim.
