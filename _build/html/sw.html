<h1>1.2. What is software?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-software" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Software is code that tells computer hardware what to do.</p>
<p>To get started, let&#8217;s write a very simple software program.</p>
<p>For this, the first thing you need to do is start a terminal with a Unix shell in it.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t tell you how to do this exactly as this is operating system (OS) dependent. At least with some versions of Mac OS, you can start the terminal by searching for &#8220;terminal&#8221; in Spotlight. On Windows 10, you can install &#8220;Windows Subsystem for Linux&#8221; (WSL). On older Windowses, there are ways to get a Unix shell like Cygwin but it&#8217;s more tricky. Searching online is your friend.</p>
<p>In the end, it could look something like this:</p>
<img alt="_images/term.png" src="_images/term.png" />
<p>Most notably, the Windows cmd.exe or PowerShell are <em>not</em> Unix shells. Typical Unix shells characteristics are the at sign (&#8220;&#64;&#8221;) designating your user name and the host name of the computer you&#8217;re logged on to, a tilde (&#8220;~&#8221;) to designate the home directory and the dollar sign (&#8220;$&#8221;) to designate the prompt. You can use these to identify whether you&#8217;re running a Unix shell or not.</p>
<p><em>Exercise</em>: Start a terminal with a Unix shell.</p>
<p>Apart from the shell, we also need an interpreter and an editor. For this chapter we&#8217;ll use Python as our programming language; so let&#8217;s install the Python interpreter. Again, I can&#8217;t tell you how to do this; some OSes may have it already installed. To find out if you have it, start your Unix shell and try typing:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ python
Python <span class="m">3</span>.6.0 <span class="o">(</span>default, Jan <span class="m">16</span> <span class="m">2017</span>, <span class="m">12</span>:12:55<span class="o">)</span>
<span class="o">[</span>GCC <span class="m">6</span>.3.1 <span class="m">20170109</span><span class="o">]</span> on linux
Type <span class="s2">&quot;help&quot;</span>, <span class="s2">&quot;copyright&quot;</span>, <span class="s2">&quot;credits&quot;</span> or <span class="s2">&quot;license&quot;</span> <span class="k">for</span> more information.
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="topic">
<p class="topic-title first">I&#8217;m supposed to type all that?</p>
<p>Actually you&#8217;re only supposed to type &#8220;python&#8221; (without quotes). On the first line, the dollar sign (&#8220;$&#8221;) means the prompt, i.e. the part of the screen where you can type. The first line effectively means &#8220;type &#8216;python&#8217;&#8221;. The following lines don&#8217;t start with the dollar sign so they&#8217;re meant to demonstrate the possible output from running the previous command.</p>
</div>
<p>If you don&#8217;t have Python, you might see something like this instead:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ python
bash: python: <span class="nb">command</span> not found
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In this case you&#8217;ll need to find out how to install it. On e.g. Ubuntu, running something like &#8220;sudo apt-get install python&#8221; might do it. On Mac you may need to install Python from the Python official web site. Although we&#8217;ll be using Python 2 later in this book, this chapter will work with either Python 2 or 3 so the version you pick isn&#8217;t very important for now.</p>
<p>Once you do get to the Python interpreter as shown above you can exit it by typing &#8220;exit()&#8221; (without the quotes).</p>
<p><em>Exercise</em>: Install the Python interpreter if your system doesn&#8217;t already have it. Run it and exit it.</p>
<p>Now that we have the shell and the interpreter, the final bit we need is the editor. For now it&#8217;s enough with an editor that&#8217;s easy to use, though Notepad, which is installed by default on Windows, won&#8217;t do. If you&#8217;re on a Linux system you can install e.g. gedit. On Windows you could install notepad++. There are other editors available like Atom or Visual Studio Code. It doesn&#8217;t really matter which one you install now, as long as you end up with a window where you can type text and save it to a file. Here&#8217;s an example of what an editor could look like:</p>
<img alt="_images/editor.png" src="_images/editor.png" />
<p><em>Exercise</em>: Install and start an editor.</p>
<p>Now we can use the editor to write some code and save it in a file, then use the shell to start the interpreter with our code as input. The interpreter will then run our code.</p>
<p>The next step is to create a file with these contents:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;Hello world&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The above is a one-line Python program (which works either with Python 2 or Python 3). When run, it will write the text &#8220;Hello world&#8221; to the terminal.</p>
<p><em>Exercise</em>: Create a file with the above contents. Call it &#8220;hello.py&#8221;. Make sure you know in which directory you saved the file.</p>
<p>Now, we need to navigate to the directory where the file was saved, and run the Python interpreter with our program as the input.</p>
<p>The directory paths are again somewhat OS dependent but you have a few tools that help you locate your file:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>You can find out which files are in the <em>current directory</em> in the shell by running &#8220;ls&#8221;.</li>
<li>You can find out what your current directory is by running &#8220;cwd&#8221; (current working directory).</li>
<li>You can change the directory by running &#8220;cd&#8221; followed by the directory. E.g. if you have a directory called &#8220;Documents&#8221; in your current working directory and you wish to change your current working directory to that directory, you can do this by running &#8220;cd Documents&#8221;.</li>
<li>You can change to the <em>parent directory</em> by running &#8220;cd ..&#8221;.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Exercise</em>: Run &#8220;ls&#8221; in your shell to see the contents of the current working directory.</p>
<p>Now we have some idea of how to navigate around the various directories in our Unix shell.</p>
<p><em>Exercise</em>: Locate your hello.py in the shell. Change to that directory. If you can&#8217;t find it, try saving to another location. If you&#8217;re on Windows you may need to consult the Windows documentation on how to find the Windows files from WSL or vice versa. If you&#8217;re stuck, you may also try to open the editor from the shell e.g. by running &#8220;gedit hello.py&#8221; (if gedit is the editor you have installed). This way, after saving the file in your editor, the file should be saved in the current working directory.</p>
<p>Now that you have your source file available, let&#8217;s run the interpreter with your source file as input by running:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ python hello.py
Hello world
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This should cause the Python interpreter to run your program which will output the text &#8220;Hello world&#8221; on the screen.</p>
<p><em>Exercise</em>: Run your program.</p>
<p>If you made it here, congratulations. You&#8217;ve written your first software.</p>
