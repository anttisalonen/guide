<h1>3.1. Vim<a class="headerlink" href="#vim" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>In general, in order to install vim, I&#8217;ll refer you to your OS. If on Linux, you should be able to install vim using your package manager, if it&#8217;s not already installed. On Mac and Windows you should be able to find a way to install it after searching online.</p>
<p>After you&#8217;ve installed vim, you can start it in Unix shell by running e.g.:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ vim file.txt
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This opens the file called &#8220;file.txt&#8221; in vim. If the file doesn&#8217;t exist, vim opens an empty buffer which, if saved, will be saved as file.txt.</p>
<p>Vim is a modal editor. This means it has <em>modes</em>. When starting vim, it is in <em>normal mode</em>. You can always get to this mode by hitting the Escape key (ESC) three times. Go ahead, try it out.</p>
<p>The second mode is the <em>command line mode</em>. You can enter this mode from the normal mode by pressing semicolon (:) (without hitting enter afterwards). You should then see a semicolon at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>In command line mode, you can enter several commands. For exit, you can enter the command to quit vim by giving the command q, i.e. typing &#8221;:q&#8221; followed by enter (or &#8221;:q&lt;Enter&gt;&#8221;). Try it out. Enter vim again.</p>
<p>Another useful command is &#8220;w&#8221;, for writing, i.e. saving a file. Try running &#8221;:w&lt;Enter&gt;&#8221;. This should save file.txt. As we didn&#8217;t enter any contents to the file, it&#8217;ll be empty.</p>
<p>You can also combine commands. For example, the command &#8221;:wq&#8221; will save and quit vim.</p>
<p>The third mode is the <em>insert mode</em>. This allows you to actually type text in the file. One way to enter this mode from the normal mode is by pressing &#8220;i&#8221;. Now, anything you type will be added in the buffer. You can exit the insert mode by pressing the Escape key.</p>
<p>For example, if you were to type &#8220;iHello.&lt;ESC&gt;&#8221;, you&#8217;d enter the insert mode, add the text &#8220;Hello.&#8221; in the file, then go back to the normal mode. Try this out. Save your file with &#8221;:w&#8221;. If you want to be sure, quit vim and run &#8220;cat file.txt&#8221; to see the file contents. Enter vim again.</p>
<p>Now you have the basics of how to use vim for general file editing. So far, there isn&#8217;t much that makes vim much better than any other editor.</p>
<div class="section" id="some-more-commands">
<h2>3.1.1. Some more commands<a class="headerlink" href="#some-more-commands" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are some more commands that are helpful when editing text. These commands are all run from the normal mode. For example, the command &#8220;Y&#8221; will copy the current line. That is, if you are in the normal mode (which you can reach by pressing ESC), then press the keys for capital Y (shift+y), you&#8217;ve copied the current line. You can then paste this line after the current line by pressing &#8220;p&#8221;. Try this out. You should then have the line &#8220;Hello.&#8221; twice.</p>
<p>You can repeat commands multiple times by entering a number before the command. Try, in the normal mode, after you&#8217;ve copied the line using &#8220;Y&#8221;, to type &#8220;10p&#8221;. This should add ten lines with the text &#8220;Hello.&#8221; in them.</p>
<p>You can undo with the command &#8220;u&#8221;. You can re-do (undo the undo) by pressing ctrl+r. Try this out a few times. You can undo until the point where you started vim, and re-do until the last command.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s modify one of our &#8220;Hello.&#8221; lines. You can use the arrow keys to move around the file (or also the h, j, k and l keys). The command &#8220;x&#8221; will remove the character under the cursor. Try it out. You can also type e.g. &#8220;3x&#8221; to remove the three next characters.</p>
<p>You can remove a whole line using the command &#8220;dd&#8221;. (This cuts the line such that you can paste it again.) You can remove the next e.g. three lines with &#8220;3dd&#8221;. Try it out. Paste them again with &#8220;P&#8221;. (Capital &#8220;P&#8221; pastes before the cursor, small &#8220;p&#8221; pastes after the cursor.) The text from the cursor to the end of the line can be removed with &#8220;D&#8221;.</p>
<p>You can navigate in the file with arrow keys, but there are shortcuts. Typing &#8220;gg&#8221; moves the cursor to the top of the file. Typing &#8220;G&#8221; moves the cursor to the end of the file. &#8220;$&#8221; moves the cursor to the end of the current line. &#8220;^&#8221; moves the cursor to the beginning of the current line.</p>
<p>Move the cursor to the top of the file with &#8220;gg&#8221;. You can delete e.g. the next 50 lines of the file by running &#8220;50dd&#8221;. Run this to empty the file.</p>
